## Project Description

Nest Finder is an application designed to assist customers/guests in finding the most suitable house based on their preferences, budget, and lifestyle. The application provides suggestions to guests who may have difficulty deciding on a house. On the admin side, Nest Finder updates customers about the latest information, including available properties, company sales, and more.

Guests can choose to view properties, register, or view company details. When viewing properties, they receive suggestions based on house type, rent, rooms, toilets, and location preferences. Guests can register their information in the system, and the details will be saved in the database.

Admins can choose to manage properties, tenants, or company information. Basic property information such as ID number, house type, rent, number of rooms and toilets, location, contact number, and a simple description can be added, edited, deleted, and updated in the database through the program.
